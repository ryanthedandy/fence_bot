# **Dark and Darker Automated Trading Bot**
----------------------------------

### **UPDATE** 
*This project is currently deprecated. The development team at IronMace implemented a quick search functionality which removed the necessesity for my script. You can still utilize the script, but it is not as useful*


 ### **About the Project** 

  *This project originated as a solution to reduce the significant time players spent trading in the game Dark and Darker, which I observed took up approximately 40% of gameplay time, detracting from the overall enjoyment. To address this, I initially developed a "quick price search" script, enabling players to locate item prices more efficiently. While effective, it only partially addressed the issue, as trading still consumed excessive time. Observing a trend where players were paying others in real currency to expedite trades, I recognized a more impactful solution: fully automate the trading process. This led to the creation of a comprehensive trading bot that autonomously handles trades, leveraging insights gained from my initial project to optimize efficiency.*
